# Model Predictive Control for Heat Pump Operation

## Introduction
Optimize the operation of a residential heat pump / electric heater by means of model predictive control (MPC).

## Model Description
More details about the MPC optimization model and its mathematical formulation are provided in the [model description](https://github.com/rebase-energy/mpchp/blob/master/docs/model_description.pdf)

## How to use
Examples of how to use the optimization model can be found [here](https://github.com/rebase-energy/mpchp/tree/master/examples)
